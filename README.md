<h1>Conducting a Security Audit</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A security audit is a review of an organization's security controls, procedures, and policies against a set of expectations. In this project, I reviewed an initial assessment of a fake company and interpretted what I read to establish what controls were being implemented as well as what compliances were being followed. Then followed up with a summary of what controls were missing and needed implementation as well as how to adhere to compliances through application of controls.
